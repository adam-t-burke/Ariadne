# Ariadne

Ariadne is the front-end counterpart to [Theseus](https://github.com/fibrous-tendencies/Theseus.jl) and is used for the directed form-finding of tensile network structures.

The easiest way to install Ariadne is to search for it in the package manager inside of Rhino, however it can also be built from the source available here if you would like to modify any of the behavior yourself.

**Documentation coming soon!**
