# Ariadne

Ariadne is the front-end counterpart to [Theseus](https://github.com/fibrous-tendencies/Theseus.jl) and is used for the directed form-finding of tensile network structures.

The easiest way to install Ariadne is to search for it in the package manager inside of Rhino, however it can also be built from the source available here or downloaded in the releases section. 

**Documentation coming soon!**
