# Examples

Example Grasshopper (`.gh`) files are kept in the repository under the [examples](https://github.com/adam-t-burke/Ariadne/tree/main/examples) folder. Open them in Rhino 8 with Grasshopper to follow the workflows.

## Download

| Example | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| *(Add .gh files to the [examples](https://github.com/adam-t-burke/Ariadne/tree/main/examples) folder and list them here with a link to the raw file.)* | |

To get a file: open the [examples README](https://github.com/adam-t-burke/Ariadne/blob/main/examples/README.md) or the table above; each example can be downloaded via the raw link (e.g. `https://github.com/adam-t-burke/Ariadne/raw/main/examples/ExampleName.gh`).

Adding an example: place the `.gh` file in the repo’s `examples/` folder, then add a row to the table in [examples/README.md](https://github.com/adam-t-burke/Ariadne/blob/main/examples/README.md) and optionally to this page with name, short description, and raw download link.
